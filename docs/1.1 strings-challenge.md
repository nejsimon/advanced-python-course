# Strings in Python: Coding Challenges

These exercises are designed to cover string manipulation, formatting, encoding, and edge cases.

---

## Challenge 1: Basic Manipulation

**Objective:** Given the string `"  Hello, World!  "`, perform the following:

* Strip whitespace
* Convert to lowercase
* Replace the comma with a dash
* Reverse the string

---

## Challenge 2: Format Report Card

**Objective:** Use f-strings to format a grade report.

```python
name = "Alice"
score = 93.456
```

**Expected output:**

```
Student: Alice | Score: 93.46
```

---

## Challenge 3: Validate Identifiers

**Objective:** Given a list of strings, print only those that are valid Python identifiers.

```python
words = ["class", "_var1", "2cool", "hello_world"]
```

Use `.isidentifier()`.

---

## Challenge 4: Normalize Unicode

**Objective:** Normalize and compare two Unicode strings.

```python
import unicodedata
s1 = "caf√©"
s2 = "cafe\u0301"
```

* Normalize using `unicodedata.normalize()`
* Compare equality

---

## Challenge 5: Word Frequency Counter

**Objective:** Given a paragraph of text, count word occurrences.

* Ignore case and punctuation
* Use `str.split()` and a `dict`

---

## Challenge 6: CSV Row Builder

**Objective:** Given a list of values, format them into a single CSV string:

```python
values = ["Alice", 93.456, "Math"]
```

Use `str.join()` and convert all items to strings.

---

## Challenge 7: Encode and Decode

**Objective:** Take a string, encode it to UTF-8 bytes, then decode it back.

* Verify that the original and round-trip result are equal

---

## Challenge 8: Dedent a Multiline String

**Objective:** Use `textwrap.dedent()` to normalize:

```python
s = """
    Line one
    Line two
"""
```

---

## Challenge 9: Case-Insensitive Search

**Objective:** Implement a case-insensitive substring match.

* Input: two strings
* Output: `True` if substring exists in a case-insensitive way
* Use `.casefold()`

---

## Challenge 10: Interned String Identity

**Objective:** Intern a list of strings and show which are the same object.

```python
import sys
words = ["cat", "dog", "cat"]
```

* Use `sys.intern()`
* Compare with `is`
