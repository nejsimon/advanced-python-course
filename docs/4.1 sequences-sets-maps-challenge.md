# Sequences, Sets, and Maps in Python: Coding Challenges

These exercises reinforce the use of Python’s built-in collection types: sequences (lists, tuples), sets, and dictionaries.

---

## Challenge 1: Reverse and Slice a List

**Objective:**
Given a list of numbers:

```python
nums = list(range(10))
```

* Reverse the list using slicing
* Extract every third number starting from index 1

---

## Challenge 2: Tuples and Packing

**Objective:**
Given a function that returns three values:

```python
def stats():
    return 4.5, 3.2, 9.8
```

* Unpack the result into named variables
* Pack the values into a tuple again manually

---

## Challenge 3: Set Operations

**Objective:**
Given two sets:

```python
s1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
s2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
```

* Compute their union, intersection, and symmetric difference
* Remove `3` from the union result

---

## Challenge 4: Dictionary Count

**Objective:**
Given a list of words:

```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry"]
```

* Count how many times each word appears using a dictionary
* Bonus: Use `collections.Counter`

---

## Challenge 5: Dictionary Comprehension

**Objective:**
Build a dictionary mapping numbers to their squares (0–9)

```python
{0: 0, 1: 1, ..., 9: 81}
```

---

## Challenge 6: Use `defaultdict` for Grouping

**Objective:**
Group values by their modulo 3:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```

Result:

```python
{0: [3, 6], 1: [1, 4, 7], 2: [2, 5]}
```

---

## Challenge 7: Use Named Tuple for Record Structure

**Objective:**
Use `collections.namedtuple` to create a `Point(x, y)` and store three such points.

* Compute the centroid (average x and y)

---

## Challenge 8: Range and Unpacking

**Objective:**
Use `range()` to generate numbers from 10 to 100 (step 10), unpack the first and last into variables `start` and `end`, and collect the rest into a list `middle`.

---

## Challenge 9: Remove Duplicates

**Objective:**
Given a list with duplicates:

```python
raw = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]
```

* Create a new list with duplicates removed using `set`
* Maintain order (bonus)

---

## Challenge 10: Nested Dictionary Transformation

**Objective:**
Given:

```python
raw = [
    {"name": "Alice", "score": 90},
    {"name": "Bob", "score": 85},
]
```

* Build a dict mapping names to scores using a comprehension
