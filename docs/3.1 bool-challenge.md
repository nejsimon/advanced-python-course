# The `bool` Type in Python: Coding Challenges

These exercises help reinforce understanding of Python's `bool` type, its interaction with other types, and its use in control flow and evaluation.

---

## Challenge 1: Falsy Filter

**Objective:**
Write a function that removes all falsy values from a list.

```python
def filter_truthy(values):
    return [x for x in values if x]

# Example:
# filter_truthy([0, 1, '', 'text', [], [1], None]) -> [1, 'text', [1]]
```

---

## Challenge 2: Short-Circuit Behavior

**Objective:**
Write two expressions that:

* Return the second value only if the first is truthy
* Return the second value only if the first is falsy

```python
# Example:
x = "hello"
y = "world"
result1 = x and y  # Should return y
result2 = not x and y  # Should return False
```

---

## Challenge 3: Custom Boolean Class

**Objective:**
Create a class whose instances are falsy if the internal count is zero.

```python
class Counter:
    def __init__(self, count):
        self.count = count

    def __bool__(self):
        return self.count > 0
```

* Test in an `if` statement

## Challenge 4: Count Boolean Truths

**Objective:**
Given a list of booleans, count how many are `True`.

```python
votes = [True, False, True, True, False]
true_count = sum(votes)  # Should be 3
```

---

## Challenge 5: Coerce to Bool

**Objective:**
Write a function that takes any input and returns either `"truthy"` or `"falsy"` depending on how Python sees it.

```python
def describe_truth(value):
    return "truthy" if bool(value) else "falsy"
```

---

## Challenge 6: Boolean Identity vs Equality

**Objective:**
Evaluate the difference between identity and equality:

```python
assert (True == 1) is True
assert (True is 1) is False
assert (False == 0) is True
assert (False is 0) is False
```

---

## Challenge 7: Boolean Evaluation of Objects

**Objective:**
Create a class with only `__len__` that returns 0. Confirm that it's falsy.

```python
class Empty:
    def __len__(self):
        return 0

assert not Empty()
```

---

## Challenge 8: Validate Input

**Objective:**
Write a function that accepts user input and prints whether it's considered truthy or falsy.

```python
def input_truth():
    user = input("Enter something: ")
    if user:
        print("Truthy")
    else:
        print("Falsy")
```
