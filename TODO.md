# General
* Info on class pattern matching is missing
* Some initial challenge code is broken / incomplete. Make sure that all python code blocks that get inserted in the generated challenge files are valid and executable even when implementations are missing. Any code that must be incomplete should be commented out or completed with placeholder code.
* Update build-code-exercises.py script to support multiple code blocks

# Strings
* Doc doesn't say anything about the slicing syntax. This should be added.
* Doc doesn't say anything about normalizing unicode. This should be added.
* Doc doesn't say anything about using the `in` operator to substring natch in a string. This should be added.
* Example code missing for Challenge 7 and Challenge 9

# Bool
* Include all() and any() in the doc

# Classes and OOP
* Doc doesn't mention callable objects

# Variables Constants and References
* Challenge already contains all the answers, and should be changed so that there are actually problems to solve.
* Should be merged with scoping and namespaces

# Scoping and Namespaces
* Challenge already contains all the answers, and should be changed so that there are actually problems to solve.
* Should be merged with Variables Constants and References

# Functions
* The scoping section duplicates "Variables Constants and References" and "Scoping and Namespaces"
* Challenge already contains all the answers, and should be changed so that there are actually problems to solve.

# List comprehension
* The doc should describe how to iterate with indexes using enumerate()
* The doc should mention that side effects are discouraged and show an alternative.

# Overloading
* Doc doesn't mention __setitem__, __getitem__ used in the challenge.

# Closures late bindings
* Should be put after functions probably
* Challenge already has the correct solutions, nothing to do really.

# Testing
* Mocking with pytest i.e. `monkeypatch` is missing

# Async await
* Missing info on awaiting coroutines vs. creating tasks
* Challenge already has the correct solutions, nothing to do really.

# Data Pipelines
* Should probably mention ProcessPoolExecturo instead of multiprocessing.Pool

# Functools
* Challenge 3 is about a custom key which doesn't exist in current versions of python
