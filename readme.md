# Advanced Python Course

This repository contains a comprehensive, in-depth course on advanced Python programming concepts, features, and patterns. It is intended for experienced developers who want to master Python’s more powerful, expressive, and sometimes obscure capabilities.

> **Target Python Version:** This course is written for **Python 3.11+**. Some features (e.g. `Self` from `typing`, improved error messages, `match-case`, performance boosts) require Python 3.10 or later.

## Structure

* All documentation is stored under the `docs/` directory.
* The documents are organized by filename to determine reading order.
* Each documentation page is followed by a matching coding challenge (e.g., `01_threading.md`, then `01_threading_challenge.md`).
* Topics range from threading, metaprogramming, and context managers to data pipelines, async contexts, and decorators.
