# Coding Challenge: Standard Library — Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)

This challenge will help you practice working with Python’s built-in GUI and TUI modules: **`tkinter`**, **`curses`**, and **`turtle`**.

---

## Part 1: Tkinter — Simple Task Tracker

1. Create a small GUI app with `tkinter` that:
   - Has a text entry field and a button labeled **Add Task**.
   - Displays tasks in a listbox.
   - Allows removing a selected task with a **Remove Task** button.
   - Closes when the window’s **Quit** button is clicked.

2. Stretch goals:
   - Save tasks to a text file when closing and load them on startup.
   - Add a checkbox to mark tasks as completed.

---

## Part 2: Curses — Terminal Dashboard (Unix Only)

1. Write a curses-based app that:
   - Displays a live **clock** at the top.
   - Shows a scrolling list of log messages (append one every second).
   - Quits when the user presses **q**.

2. Stretch goals:
   - Add color to the UI.
   - Display CPU/memory usage using `psutil` (optional external dependency).

---

## Part 3: Turtle — Drawing Challenge

1. Use the `turtle` module to draw:
   - A **square spiral** pattern.
   - A **star** shape with 5 or more points.

2. Stretch goals:
   - Draw a simple **fractal tree** using recursion.
   - Add interactivity: e.g., press a key to change the turtle’s color.

## Bonus Challenge: Choose Your Toolkit

Pick one of the three modules (`tkinter`, `curses`, `turtle`) and create a **mini-application** of your choice.  
Examples:
- A `tkinter` calculator.
- A `curses` file explorer.
- A `turtle` game like “race to the finish”.
